# Welcome to Site Validator

[Site Validator](http://sitevalidator.com/) lets you validate HTML and CSS on large sites, with a single click.

## Quick Start

To begin validating your sites you need to create an account by choosing a [plan](http://sitevalidator.com/). Once you have created an account, you'll be prompted to validate your first site.

Enter the starting URL, the number of pages to validate from there, and the kind of validations to run on each page, and you're ready to go.
